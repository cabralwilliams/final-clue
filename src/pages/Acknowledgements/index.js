            <p>While on very rare occasions I am able to answer some of these Final Jeopardy! &reg; clues, I do not have all of these questions memorized, nor do I have the statistics for these players archived anywhere.</p>
            <p><a href='https://www.j-archive.com/'>J! Archive</a> was absolutely invaluable to me in getting detailed player statistics.  The depth of statistical information that the site has it truly breathtaking!</p>
            <p>Though J! Archive was useful as a resource for some of the clues used here, <a href='https://fikklefame.com/category/jeopardy-today/'>Fikkle Fame's Jeopary Recaps</a> were extremely useful in providing detailed information about clues and entire games.</p>
